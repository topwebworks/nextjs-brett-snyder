    'I was told their busy season started 3 weeks ago, and they needed several landing pages - fast. Late nights may be required. WordPress, custom CMS, and standalone - mutiple brands. I quickly built a Tailwind inspired modular custom HTML template & demo that allowed for platform & variable overrides. Now landing pages can be setup before the job ticket is.',

export default (props) => <ArticleLayout meta={meta} {...props} />

Thursday - high-noon, Marketing told me they needed some landing pages - fast. Their busy season has started without them. This was expressed to me with great urgency. Understandably so. The team of designers, writers, social, and leadership all like access to directly edit the content, even play with the layout blocks - change images, icons, etc. Their platforms are WordPress and a custom DotNet CMS hosting 6 different product brands. Some brands will have more than one campaign. They gave me a wireframe to stay building the first of many landing pages.

I thought, what would be the fastest most efficient path to churn these out? I knew the proceess would need a template. The fact Marketing needs direct code access very soon, and will eventually want to edit them directly, removes any option of introducing a new framework like Tailwind or a static site generator. The pages have to be in HTML/CSS so the designers and writers have the ability to edit and repurpose them in the future. The marketing team been working with basic html in cms buckets and widgets already.

## Elevator Pitch

By Thursday late afternoon, I threw together a <a href="https://www.figma.com/file/RsPli1nlGQuaH6KcpPDWCd/Master-LP-Blocks-Graybox?node-id=0%3A1" target="samples">Figma wireframe</a> showing what a master template might be like - reflecting their provided wireframe elements - and then some. The concept was create a flex template of content blocks that are modular and portable. Each block and child element can be moved or deleted without breaking the layout. The template would include all the possible elements they would need, and we can whittle it down from there. It was approved and I was off to the races.

## Default Block Sequence

All blocks can be moved but what is the best default sequence? Having done some UI a/b testing before, my heatmaps showed most all conversions take place above the fold. The template needs to be able to work with or without a cms header and footer - a CSS override section is needed to reset existing cms styles. It also needs to have modular branding, so using css variables. If I want to keep the content blocks portable, I would need a global and individual css block seperation. Lastly, there should be a "user" style override section so the core styles are not erased and break the template upgrade&nbsp;path.

1. **Hero** block maxed out might have a simple leadgen form, phone, logo, title, subtext and 2 buttons. The hero background should be able to house a video background and modal. I prefer no nav links because it detracts from conversions, these pages are not microsites...but included one nav link just incase.

2. **Centered Text** block is to welcome and reinforce what the hero did not say clearly. It could include jump links or buttons to draw them down the page.

3. **Benefits** and features, each with buttons and download links. Also include a floating call now button that launches if the user clicks on a benefit icon...they always do. Also show the floating call button after the fold.

4. **Tabs** to easily inform and ecourage a conversion.

5. **Split L/R** content alternate blocks for pacing. Establish value with a deeper expert explanation or pricing options. Mix in user testimonials and a call now button.

6. **CTA** shows a nobrainer offer. Of course I will click this!

7. **Infobar** is not a large CTA block but a good content divider or small footer that shows a small button, links, etc.

8. **Chat Widget** integration - only used if no existing cms header in play.

## The Build

On Friday, I started knocking out the blocks I know Marketing initially needed. Hero, Ceneter Text, Benefits, Split L/R, CTA, and Infobar. By Monday it was ready to test. To show it off I inspected elements in Chrome dev tools, moved and deleted blocks in-browser to create the initial wireframe they gave me in just minutes. The beauty of using flex is how forgiving removing or duplicating elements are. Here is the page structure I used to get started.

```c

```

The approach is either myself, or a designer, is able to cut and paste code blocks in-browser first to try out different layouts. Then screen capture that for approval or to hand-off for assets or development. There are brand specific styles that include color variable and cms style overrides. To customize further, use in-browser style edits. Then cut and paste what looks good for spacing, images, etc into the "Your Override Styles" section.

1. Open template with VSCode > Live Server Extension in Chrome.
2. Inspect (F12) elements using Dev Tools > Elements - delete/edit/move elements to test custom layouts.
3. In VSCode, comment out (Ctrl /), move or delete collapsed elements. Review start/end tags.
4. Add new or copy existing "CORE CSS STYLES" to "YOUR OVERRIDE STYLES" at bottom of the CSS.

After the initial launch, I added more blocks and features to the <a href="https://www.brettsnyder.me/demo/master-blocks/aop-master-lp-blocks.html" target="samples">template</a> - Tabs, Modal, Video Background, Floating Button, and standalone Chat. I also created a <a href="https://www.brettsnyder.me/demo/master-blocks/example-aop-lp.html" target="samples">demo</a> to illustrate use for the designers. Here is a <a href="https://www.calvertacademy.com/landing/private-learning-experience-with-accreditation/" target="samples">landing page</a> that is wrapped in the cms header and footer.

Now custom cms landing pages are created in a fraction of the time. They can also work as standalone pages, just have to add in the missing html head&nbsp;code.
