I remember my daily trips to the nice Linotype lady. She would set the type for my ads and flyers. I would wax them up on a chromecoat for the printer. Or the empowerement I felt when I borrowed my boss's Mac Plus to bypass that Linotype step. Here are a few of my favorite print projects.

## Catalogs

Here is a mockup board I did for Franklin Covey. This piece stood out to me since I went for a more airy clean feel. A sharp contrast to their common dark, heavy, and cluttered look. My preference is more whitespace over dense content. I think it's easier to read and more inviting.

## Mailers

Don't you love all the direct mail you get every week? Sorry, some of that was me. The question you should always ask yourself is does the value I am presenting make it a no-brainer for the customer? If not, don't waste your time or theirs. If so, you will build brand loyalty. Here was a simple mailer for the Iomega Zip drive...and yes, new colors. Concept was nerd to a cool hipster. Crammed alot of freebies and value content in, but it worked well.

## Logos

Instead of showing all my logos, here is one. One color. Variations. Simple. Clean.

## Brochures

Reebok wanted to show off their new ellipticals. I added motion lines and bold text. I pushed most text to the outside to allow for larger product images. I also added a few callouts to highlight the features.

Over the years, I have designed print media from newspaper, brochures, newsletters, catalogs, direct mail, magazine ads, billboards, stationery, packaging, and more. I have worked with printers and prepress houses. Been on press-checks from Hong Kong to other major cities.
